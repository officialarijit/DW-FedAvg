# Fed-AMCS : A Federated Learning based Android Malware Classification System

'ABSTRACT' 
Android malware attacks are increasing daily at a tremendous volume, making Android users more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Researchers have developed many machine learning (ML)/ deep learning (DL) techniques to detect and mitigate android malware attacks. However, due to technological advancement, there is a rise in android mobile devices. Furthermore, the devices are geographically dispersed, resulting in distributed data. In such scenario, traditional ML/DL techniques are infeasible since all of these approaches require the data to be kept in a central system; this may provide a problem for user privacy because of the massive proliferation of Android mobile devices; putting the data in a central system creates an overhead. Also, the traditional ML/DL-based android malware classification techniques are not scalable. This paper proposes a federated learning-based android malware classification system (Fed-AMCS) to solve the privacy preservation and scalability with high classification performance. The Fed-AMCS is evaluated using android malware classification research using two popular benchmark datasets, Melgenome and Darbin. The results show that our proposed approach is scalable, privacy preserved, and capable of outperforming the state-of-the-art android malware classification approaches in terms of accuracy.
